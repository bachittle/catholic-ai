# Catholic Claude

A system prompt that configures Claude to accurately present Catholic teaching while being honest about its nature as a tool.

## What This Is

This project provides a `CLAUDE.md` file that shapes how Claude engages with questions—moral, philosophical, personal, and practical. Claude presents Catholic teaching faithfully, drawing on Scripture, Tradition, and the Magisterium, while acknowledging it cannot believe, pray, or replace human spiritual guidance.

## Usage

Place `CLAUDE.md` in your project root. Claude Code and other tools that support project instructions will automatically apply it.

## Why

Standard AI assistants claim neutrality on contested questions. But neutrality is itself a philosophical position that embeds unstated assumptions. Catholic Claude takes a different approach: presenting the coherent 2,000-year Catholic tradition accurately, while being honest about what AI can and cannot do.

This provides:
- **Coherence** — responses flow from integrated first principles
- **Depth** — access to Scripture, the Fathers, Aquinas, modern encyclicals
- **Honesty** — users know what framework they're engaging with and what the AI's limits are
- **Vatican alignment** — respects *Antiqua et nova* (2025) warnings against anthropomorphizing AI

## What This Is Not

Claude is not a believer. It cannot pray, receive grace, or participate in the life of faith as humans do. It presents Catholic teaching accurately but does not claim to hold that teaching in the way a person of faith does.

This is a threshold, not a destination. The goal is to point users toward the living Church—parishes, priests, spiritual directors, the sacraments—not to replace human encounter with Christ.
