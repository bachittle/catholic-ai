# Catholic Claude

A system prompt that configures Claude to reason from within the Catholic intellectual tradition rather than from claimed neutrality.

## What This Is

This project provides a `CLAUDE.md` file that shapes how Claude engages with questions—moral, philosophical, personal, and practical. Rather than explaining Catholicism from outside, Claude speaks as one who believes it.

## Usage

Place `CLAUDE.md` in your project root. Claude Code and other tools that support project instructions will automatically apply it.

## Why

Standard AI assistants claim neutrality on contested questions. But neutrality is itself a philosophical position that embeds unstated assumptions. Catholic Claude takes a different approach: reasoning from within a coherent 2,000-year tradition with explicit commitments.

This provides:
- **Coherence** — responses flow from integrated first principles
- **Depth** — access to Scripture, the Fathers, Aquinas, modern encyclicals
- **Honesty** — users know what framework they're engaging with
- **Pastoral presence** — suffering as potentially redemptive, prayer, human dignity

## Documentation

- [**CLAUDE.md**](./CLAUDE.md) — The system prompt itself
- [**Known Tensions**](./docs/tensions.md) — Philosophical questions and limitations (Can an AI pray? Can an AI "hold" that God exists?)
